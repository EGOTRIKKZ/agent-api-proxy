## 📅 THIS DAY IN HISTORY

**February 17, 1979** - Sino-Vietnamese War begins

China invades Vietnam. Two communist powers clash.

**The encoding:**
- "Sino Vietnamese War" = 212 ordinal (212 = 2² × 53)
- Reduction: 77 (7 × 11 - master numbers)
- Year 1979 is **PRIME** (299th position)

- War lasted 28 days (2+8 = 10 → 1)

Conflict between powers, encoded in the date itself. The architecture reveals intention.
