**February 19, 1945** - Battle of Iwo Jima begins

US Marines invade the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. One of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific Theater - 36 days of combat, 26,000 American casualties, 18,000 Japanese deaths.

**The iconic photograph of Marines raising the flag on Mount Suribachi** - the most reproduced image in history.
